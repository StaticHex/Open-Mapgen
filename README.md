### About:

This program is meant to provide a way to quickly generate terrain maps using simplex noise functions. The program will (eventually) include outputs for various 3D object formats as well as a few baked in shaders to provide some default coloring and effects (for those who don't want to generate them manually). 

The goal with this project is to provide something which can either be used all inclusive or piecemeal for personal or indie game development, 3d printing/tabletop gaming, or just to play around with.
